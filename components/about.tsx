      <h2>About me </h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate Junior Web Developer who has recently completed an
        intensive full-stack bootcamp, immersing myself in the world of web
        technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React,
        Next.js, and MongoDB, among others. My technical skills are complemented
        by strong communication abilities, stemming from my background in
        Journalism. I've honed my expertise in digital marketing and social
        media, which adds a unique layer to my skill set. Drawing from my
        knowledge in web design, I seamlessly integrate aesthetic principles
        into my frontend work, creating user-centric and visually appealing
        digital experiences.
      </p>
      My insatiable curiosity defines my approach to life and work. I am driven
      by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, always seeking to broaden my
      horizons and embrace new challenges. This enthusiasm keeps me in a
      constant state of motion, whether I'm deepening my understanding of
      emerging technologies or uncovering novel ways to enhance my coding
      prowess. With an unwavering commitment to growth, I find joy in the
      process of continuous learning, a quality that propels me forward as I
      strive to create innovative and impactful solutions in the ever-evolving
      landscape of web development.
